Consistently with the policy of the law, an employer should not be held liable for acts totally unconnected with the employment. **The decided cases and connection with the employment** 17 Because the law strives for coherence, the courts commonly look to decided cases for guidance as to when vicarious liability may be said to arise. Such an approach was said in _Prince Alfred College_ to be orthodox and one which should be followed^26. It has been regarded as a first step by the Supreme Court of Canada^27. 18 More recently, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom confirmed the need and utility of such an approach. In _Various Claimants v Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc_^28 , Lord Reed PSC (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) explained that the approach taken in _Mohamud v Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc_^29 , as to whether it was fair and just to impose liability, was not to be understood as an invitation to judges to decide cases according to their personal sense of justice; rather it requires them to consider how guidance derived from decided cases furnishes a solution to the case before the court. Judges should identify factors or principles which point towards or away from vicarious liability in the case before the court and which explain why it should or should not be imposed. 19 Generally speaking this is the approach which was commended in _Prince Alfred College_^30 concerning the determination of the question whether an employee's wrongful act was committed in the course or scope of employment.

In that case the employee, a barmaid, assaulted a customer by throwing a glass at him when he asked to speak to the licensee. Dixon J held^43 that the barmaid could not be said to have acted in the course of her employment in taking that action. Her actions were \"quite unconnected\" with her employment. They were not done under the employer's express or implied authority, or as an incident of or in consequence of anything she was employed to do. 27 The Supreme Court of Canada has applied the test of connection. In _Jacobi v Griffiths_^44 , it was observed that Sir John Salmond's test of connectedness was endorsed by the Privy Council in _Canadian Pacific Railway Co v Lockhart_^45 and by the Canadian Supreme Court in _W W Sales Ltd v City of Edmonton_^46. In _Bazley v Curry_^47 , it was said that the question in each case is whether there is a connection or nexus between the employment enterprise and the wrong which justifies the allocation of risk. And in _Jacobi v Griffiths_^48 , it was further said that this nexus needs to be a sufficiently strong connection to impose vicarious liability. The majority there referred to _Lloyd v Grace, Smith & Co_^49 as a case where the requisite connection was established. 28 In _Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd_^50 , Lord Steyn observed that cases after _Lloyd v Grace, Smith & Co_ focussed on \"the connection between the nature of the employment and the tort of the employee\". _Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd_ involved the **41** (1949) 79 CLR 370 at 379-381. **42** (1919) 26 CLR 110. **43** _Deatons Pty Ltd v Flew_ (1949) 79 CLR 370 at 380-382. **44** [1999] 2 SCR 570 at 604 [55]. **45** [1942] AC 591 at 599. **46** [1942] SCR 467 at 470-471. **47** [1999] 2 SCR 534 at 557 [37]. **48** [1999] 2 SCR 570 at 602 [53]. **49** [1912] AC 716. **50** [2002] 1 AC 215 at 224 [17].
